The following Tailwind CSS classes are causing unexpected behavior:

```html
<div class="flex justify-center items-center">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 rounded-lg text-white">
    Some text
  </div>
</div>
```

The `justify-center` class is not working as expected, causing the inner div not to be centered horizontally.  Additionally, the `bg-red-500` class is not applying the correct background color.
