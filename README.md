# Tailwind CSS Class Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered when using certain Tailwind CSS classes.  The `justify-center` class fails to center an element horizontally, and the `bg-red-500` class does not apply the expected red background color.  The solution provided addresses these issues.

## Bug

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code.  The inner div should be horizontally centered and have a red background, but this is not the case. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the solution, ensuring the expected behavior of both classes.
